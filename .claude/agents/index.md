## How to Use Agents

Agents are specialized modules that can be invoked through the Task tool to handle complex, domain-specific tasks. Each agent has deep expertise in their respective area and can autonomously complete tasks within their domain.

When working with agents:
1. Choose the appropriate agent based on your task requirements
2. Provide clear, detailed instructions about what you need
3. The agent will work autonomously to complete the task
4. Results will be returned for your review
